# Sentiment-Analysis
A program that rates the sentiment of a statement from 0-4. It parses through the text file, which is a collection of movie reviews taken from the Rotten Tomatoes website, and uses the ratings of the movies to determine how positive or negative a particular word is. It then gets the average rating of all the words in the given statement.
